## The Solution - Run in Order

### Step 1: Run FIX_CHAT_USER_PROFILES.sql (2 min)
```
Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor ‚Üí Paste ‚Üí Run
```

Creates view + backfills usernames from email addresses.

### Step 2: Run FIX_DM_AND_USERNAMES.sql (1 min)  
```
Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor ‚Üí Paste ‚Üí Run
```

Fixes DM trigger + verifies everything works.

### Step 3: Restart App (1 min)
```bash
npx expo start -c
```

## Expected Results

### Before ‚ùå
```
? unknown
Can't send DMs
Can't see your own messages
```

### After ‚úÖ
```
üë§ @admin (You)
DMs work perfectly
Real usernames showing
Auto-scroll working
```

## Quick Test

1. **Login** to app
2. **Send message** in channel
   - ‚úÖ Should see: `üë§ @yourusername (You)`
   - ‚úÖ Should auto-scroll to your message
3. **Send DM** to someone
   - ‚úÖ Should send without errors
4. **Check other users**
   - ‚úÖ Should see real usernames (not "unknown")

## If Something's Wrong

### Still "unknown"?
```sql
-- Check if view works:
SELECT * FROM chats_public_with_id LIMIT 5;
```

### DMs still failing?
```sql
-- Check trigger exists:
SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'dm_message_unread_trigger';
```

### Clear cache and try again:
```bash
npx expo start -c
```

## Files to Run

1. `FIX_CHAT_USER_PROFILES.sql` - First
2. `FIX_DM_AND_USERNAMES.sql` - Second
3. Clear app cache - Third

**Total Time:** 4 minutes
**Fixes:** All 3 major chat issues
