## ✅ What We Found Working Well

1. ✅ Mobile app uses proper anon key (not service_role)
2. ✅ No critical dependencies vulnerabilities in mobile app
3. ✅ Some RLS policies implemented (chats table)
4. ✅ Privacy-safe leaderboard hides PII
5. ✅ No dangerous code patterns (eval, XSS)

4. Save new key securely (server-side only)
5. ⏱️ Time: 10 minutes

**Step 2: Remove Service Key from Admin Panel**
1. Edit `admin/.env` - remove `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
2. Edit `admin/src/lib/supabase.js` - use anon key instead
3. Apply PATCH 1 from `SECURITY_PATCHES.md`
4. ⏱️ Time: 2 hours

**Step 3: Add Admin Authentication**
1. Create admin login page
2. Add `is_admin` column to user_profiles table
3. Implement role checks on all admin routes
4. Apply PATCH 5 from `SECURITY_PATCHES.md`
5. ⏱️ Time: 6-8 hours

**Step 4: Enable Row Level Security**
1. Run SQL script from `SECURITY_PATCHES.md` PATCH 4
2. Enable RLS on all user tables
3. Test that users can only see their own data
4. ⏱️ Time: 4-6 hours

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong:
1. Service role key treated as regular env variable
2. No security review before production
3. Missing authentication on admin panel
4. No RLS enabled during database setup
5. Secrets committed to git without scanning

### How to Prevent:
1. ✅ Security review checklist for every deployment
2. ✅ Automated secret scanning in CI/CD
3. ✅ Mandatory RLS on all new tables
4. ✅ Admin features require separate auth flow
5. ✅ Pre-commit hooks to prevent secret commits
