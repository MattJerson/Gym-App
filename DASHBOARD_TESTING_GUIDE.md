## 🔍 Data Verification

### Check Real Data is Loading:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Check for errors** - Should see no red errors
3. **Verify API calls**:
   ```
   - profiles (user count)
   - user_subscriptions (subscriptions)
   - workout_logs (workouts)
   - user_meals (meals)
   - user_stats (top users)
   ```

### Expected Data Flow:
```
Loading state → Fetch from Supabase → Calculate metrics → Display
```

### Metrics Should Show:
- **Real numbers** from your database (not 0 or undefined)
- **Growth percentages** (positive or negative)
- **Email addresses** in recent activity
- **Workout details** (duration, calories)

---

## 📊 Metrics Calculation Verification

### User Growth:
```javascript
Current month users - Last month users = New users
(New users / Last month users) * 100 = Growth %
```

### MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue):
```javascript
For each active subscription:
  - If monthly: Add price_monthly
  - If yearly: Add (price_yearly / 12)
Total = MRR
```

### Engagement Rate:
```javascript
Users with workouts in last 7 days / Total users * 100 = Engagement %
```

### Churn Risk:
```javascript
Users with no activity in 14+ days / Total users * 100 = Churn %
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dashboard Shows All Zeros
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure demo data is seeded:
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
   -- File: seed_demo_users_v2.sql
   ```
2. Check `.env` has correct Supabase credentials

### Issue: "font-display" Not Working
**Solution**: Font is configured in Tailwind v4 with `@theme` directive. If not working, the default font will still look good.

### Issue: No Recent Activity Showing
**Solution**: 
1. Check that demo users have created_at timestamps
2. Verify workout_logs table has recent data
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Subscription Data Not Loading
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure `subscription_packages` table exists
2. Verify foreign key relationships
3. Check `user_subscriptions` has `status = 'active'` records

### Issue: Email Addresses Not Showing
**Solution**: 
1. Requires `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env`
2. Check that `supabase.auth.admin.listUsers()` has permissions
3. Verify auth.users table has email data
