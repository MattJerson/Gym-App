## 🎯 Key Findings Summary

### Critical Issues (MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY)
1. **CRIT-001:** Service role key exposed in admin panel client code
   - **Risk:** Complete database compromise
   - **Fix:** Rotate key, remove from client, use backend API

2. **CRIT-002:** Service role key committed to git history
   - **Risk:** Permanent exposure in repository
   - **Fix:** Rotate key, clean git history

3. **CRIT-003:** No admin authorization mechanism
   - **Risk:** Anyone can access admin panel
   - **Fix:** Implement admin login + role verification

### High Priority Issues
4. **HIGH-001:** Insecure token storage (AsyncStorage)
5. **HIGH-002:** Sensitive data in console.log
6. **HIGH-003:** No RLS on most tables
7. **HIGH-004:** FOODDATA API key exposed in .env

## 🎓 Lessons & Best Practices

### What This Audit Revealed
1. **Service role keys are extremely sensitive** - Never in client code
2. **Authentication ≠ Authorization** - Admin needs both
3. **RLS must be default** - Enable on all new tables
4. **Secure storage matters** - AsyncStorage insufficient for tokens
5. **Production logging risks** - Console.log can leak PII

### Future Prevention
1. ✅ Security checklist for every PR
2. ✅ Automated secret scanning in CI/CD
3. ✅ Mandatory RLS on database creation
4. ✅ Pre-commit hooks for sensitive patterns
5. ✅ Regular security training for team
