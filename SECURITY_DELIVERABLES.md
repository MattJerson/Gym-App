## 🎓 Key Takeaways

### What This Audit Revealed:
1. **Service role keys are nuclear codes** - Never expose in client
2. **Admin panel needs separate auth** - Not just service_role bypass
3. **RLS must be default-on** - Enable for all user tables
4. **AsyncStorage is NOT secure** - Use Keychain/Keystore for tokens
5. **Console.log leaks data** - Production logging needs safeguards

### How to Prevent Future Issues:
1. ✅ Security checklist in PR template
2. ✅ Automated secret scanning (pre-commit + CI/CD)
3. ✅ RLS-first database design
4. ✅ Separate admin authentication flow
5. ✅ Regular security training

$findings.findings | Group-Object severity | 
  Select-Object Name, Count

# Critical issues
$findings.findings | Where-Object { $_.severity -eq "CRITICAL" } |
  Select-Object id, title
```
