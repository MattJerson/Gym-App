# ⚡ QUICK FIX SUMMARY - Workout Duplicate Error

## 🐛 Error You Were Seeing

```
Failed to save workout preferences: duplicate key value violates unique constraint
```

## ✅ What I Fixed

Changed workout saving from `.insert()` to `.upsert()` in the onboarding completion code.

**File**: `app/features/selectmealplan.jsx` (Line ~194)

## 🚀 What To Do Now

### **Option 1: Just Restart the App** (Recommended)
```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running Expo
# Then restart:
npx expo start
```

The fix is already applied! Just restart and test.

### **Option 2: Clean Existing Duplicates** (Optional)
If you want to clean up any existing duplicate entries:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- This removes duplicate workout assignments (keeps the newest)
DELETE FROM user_saved_workouts a
USING user_saved_workouts b
WHERE a.id < b.id
  AND a.user_id = b.user_id
  AND a.template_id = b.template_id;
```
