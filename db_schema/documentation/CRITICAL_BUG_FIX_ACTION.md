# üö® CRITICAL BUG FIXED - ACTION REQUIRED

## üêõ What Was Wrong

Your registration data (`gender`, `fitness_goal`, `height_cm`, `weight_kg`) was being **overwritten with nulls** by `selectmealplan.jsx` after you completed the onboarding!

**Why**: `selectmealplan.jsx` tried to save registration data from AsyncStorage, but AsyncStorage was already cleared, so it saved empty/null values, overwriting your good data.

---

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed

### **File 1: `app/features/selectmealplan.jsx`**
- Added check: Only save registration data if AsyncStorage has data
- If AsyncStorage is empty (already cleared), **skip** the save
- Prevents overwriting good data with nulls

### **File 2: `app/features/registrationprocess.jsx`**
- Added detailed logging to see what's being saved
- Changed to return saved data for verification

### **File 3: `app/auth/loginregister.jsx`**
- Already has per-field logging from earlier fix

---

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### **Step 1: Clean Your Database** (30 seconds)

Your current registration profile has all nulls. Fix it manually:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Replace YOUR_USER_ID with: 630b464a-eef3-4b5d-a91f-74c82e75fa21

UPDATE registration_profiles
SET 
  gender = 'female',
  fitness_goal = 'maintain',
  height_cm = 180,
  weight_kg = 100,
  age = 20,
  activity_level = 'light',
  calorie_goal = 2000,
  meals_per_day = 4,
  use_metric = true,
  fitness_level = 'intermediate',
  training_location = 'gym',
  training_duration = 30,
  training_frequency = '4',
  meal_type = 'omnivore',
  muscle_focus = ARRAY['legs_glutes'],
  injuries = ARRAY[]::text[],
  restrictions = ARRAY['dairy-free']
WHERE user_id = '630b464a-eef3-4b5d-a91f-74c82e75fa21';
```

### **Step 2: Restart App**
```powershell
# Stop Expo (Ctrl+C)
npx expo start
```

### **Step 3: Test Login**
1. Try to login with your account
2. **Check console logs** - should see:
   ```
   Profile data found: { gender: "female", fitness_goal: "maintain", ... }
   Has essential fields: true
   Login successful, navigating to home
   ```
3. Should go to HOME page! ‚úì

## üß™ Test Fresh Onboarding (Optional)

To test the fix with a new account:

1. Create new test account
2. Complete full onboarding
3. **Watch console logs**:
   ```
   === REGISTRATION SAVE DEBUG ===
   Payload: { gender: "female", ... }
   ‚úÖ Registration saved successfully!
   
   === SELECTMEALPLAN DEBUG ===
   Registration data from AsyncStorage: {}
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping registration save - no data (already saved)
   ```
4. Login ‚Üí Should work! ‚úì

## üìù What to Look For

### **‚úÖ Good Signs**:
```
=== REGISTRATION SAVE DEBUG ===
Payload: { 
  gender: "female",
  fitness_goal: "maintain",

  weight_kg: 100
}
‚úÖ Registration saved to Supabase successfully!

=== SELECTMEALPLAN DEBUG ===
‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping registration save - no data (already saved)
```

```
